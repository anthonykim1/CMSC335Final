## Application Description
Our project leverages Yahoo Finance API to fetch financial data, particularly the closing price of a particular stock on a particular date.
We use this information to allow users to add their stocks that they have bought previously, and help them keep track of their accumulative net gain/loss for all of the transactions they provide. 

### User Directions
* Sign up with your *name, username, and password*
* You will be directed to a page where you can insert your stock information
  * Notes: Make sure you are putting a valid and accurate ticker symbol when inserting your transaction (ex. TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, FB...)
* After leaving the website, you can log back in with your credentials to view the your previous stock transactions and balance.
